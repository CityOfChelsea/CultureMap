We are thrilled to have Internationally known artist and author Caleb Neelon here, donating his time and talent! You can enjoy more of Calebs beautiful work, gracing the walls of the Jordan Boys and Girls Club.  Artist and author Caleb Neelon (SONIK) began his graffiti career like anyone else, but the Cambridge, Massachusetts native took a hard right and caught a flight out of town. Deliberately ignoring the obvious global centers of New York, Los Angeles and London, Caleb painted subject matter close to his heart while making a street presence in places like Kathmandu, Sao Paulo, and Tegucigalpa. Across, around and in between five continents, indoors and out, Caleb has pulled off some unique, colorful and heartfelt work both alongside collaborators like Os Gemeos and Andrew Schoultz, as well as in streets where he is the first foreigner let alone street painter to wander in quite some time.",,
