| Historic districts                               | Completed                 | Under the settings menu, users can toggle the display of historic districts. When users click on a historic district, a popup lists all historic districts that encompass that point.                                                                                                                                                                   |

| Customization of styles                          | Completed                 | CultureMap fonts, colors, and other stylings can be customized, but some knowledge of cascading style sheets (css) and front-end web development are required.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Filtering by date of asset construction/activity | Possible, but not planned | Creating a time slider is possible (see demo [here](http://dwilhelm89.github.io/LeafletSlider/)), but would require significant custom development in order to play nicely with point clustering.                                                                                                                                                       |

It is possible to trigger this popup on page load.                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Ability to moderate submissions                  | Completed                 | Submissions are moderated either with the Editor App or by editing data directly on ArcGIS Online. The field "STATUS," if changed to a 1, will reveal the cultural asset to public-facing maps.                                                                                                                                                         |
| Sidebar display                                  | Completed                 | A sidebar lists cultural assets displayed on the map.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Improved photos                                  | In progress               | Many assets lack decent online photos. The project's research assistant will gather as many photos as is feasible.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Online documentation                             | In progress               | The research assistant's thesis project will include documentation and will be made available online.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
